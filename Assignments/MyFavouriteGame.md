## My Favourite Game â€“ Horizon Forbidden West
_Horizon Forbidden West_, created by [Guerrilla Games](https://www.guerrilla-games.com/) as part of Playstation Studios, is a 2022 open world action RPG, produced using Guerrilla's in-house Decima engine - an engine also used by Kojima Productions and Supermassive Games. It's a sequel to the breakout open world game _Horizon Zero Dawn_, released in 2017. 

### Why is it my Favourite Game?
If I'm being honest, there are so many things I love about HFW. For one, the visuals are absolutely stunning on PS5, with incredibly detailed textures and lighting making for an incredibly immersive and cinematic experience.

In addition, the game does a beautiful job of improving on many aspects of the original. The addition of the glider, a refinement of the combat systems, MoCap facial animations, and other features all make it feel a lot more polished. The soundtrack is just as beautiful as the first game, but also features more adaptive elements with creative use of vertical layering. 

### Similar Games

Horizon Forbidden West exists in a genre with loads of previous entries, and seems to cherry pick the best parts out of each and improve upon them in its own way.

- [Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild](https://zelda.nintendo.com/breath-of-the-wild/) Notoriously released a week after Horizon Zero Dawn, Horizon Forbidden West inevitably drew inspiration from its sister game. Perhaps most notably, the addition of a glider and improved climbing systems in Forbidden West can clearly be tied back to Breath of the Wild. 

- [The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim](https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/skyrim) The 2011 Bethesda smash hit Skyrim inevitably had massive ripple effects on the open-world game genre. Elements such as the mission structure, level design, and open storytelling all can be tied to Skyrim.

- [Assassin's Creed 2](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/assassins-creed-ii) Often regarded as the definitive Assassin's Creed, elements of the Assassin's Creed franchise went on to massively influence games produced therafter. For example, the use of 'Towers' to unlock the map and emphasis on stealth kills both can be tied to this franchise.

- [Horizon Zero Dawn](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/horizon-zero-dawn/) Of course, one can't talk about Horizon Forbidden West without addressing the first entry in the series, Horizon Zero Dawn. With its incredible graphics, adrenaline-inducing combat systems, and engaging story and worldbuilding, it set a high bar for Horizon Forbidden West to pass.
